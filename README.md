The 2 questions I wanted to answer:

    1. Which destinations were used the most by each gender? And what could the differences and, if any overlap, similarities mean?

    2. Do the longest trip duration locations for Starting and Ending bike dropoff spots have any overlap (implying consistent use ridership to and from work each day)?

Some of the answers that could be teased out:

    Slide 1: No stated gender riders - When looking at the locations that were most popular, many were located near scenic places, like Central Park and the waterfront. This could imply day pass use, as no gender is input for day usage.

    Slide 2: Female riders - Prefered destiations clustered around shopping close to the center of Manhattan, with Battery park being a large draw that could be considered scenic.

    Slide 3: Male riders - Prefered Madison Square Garden and Grand Central Station, implying that much of the use for male riders is likely for use to and from work after riding a train from elsewhere and going to sporting events.

    Slide 4: Dashboard for Gender comparison. Shows the overlap between male and female riders around Broadway shoping areas, and very little overlap with no stated gender destiations. This slightly strengthens the scenic day use argument to help explain much of the no stated gender data. 

    Slide 5: Story 1

    Slide 6: Starting locations with the longest trip duration - Trying to see if there is areas that are used more frequently and consistently for work use (could be a good area to increase the number of bikes stations to encourage more daily ridership).

    Slide 7: Destiation locations with longest trip duration - Showed no overlap on any given station, likely implying that there are no specific areas that use the bike for daily use to and from work. 

    Slide 8: Shows the comparison between Slide 6 and Slide 7. Though there is no direct overlap, much of the longest trip duration riders are in south Manhattan and Queens, indicating that expansion into Queens could increase profits as longer trips more frequently triggers the threshold charge increase after 45 minutes for subscribers (goes to $4 every 15 minutes after 45 minute ride), and 30 minutes for day passes.
